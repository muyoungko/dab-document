## API host of mobile

You can set common host for mobile app to communicate with your own api server.
Also we provide full url.
You can set host and web host in [console > project > setting](https://www.devil-app-builder.com/project/setting)

For example
- There is Jevil.getThen function for http rest api

```js filename="HTTP Get with pre-defined api host"

//This actually call [api host] + /api/product/list
Jevil.getThen('/member/hello', function(res) {
    ...
})
```


- Also you can call 

```js filename="HTTP Get with full url"

Jevil.getThen('https://api.mondayless.co.kr/member/hello', function(res) {
    ...
})
```


Following functions use pre-defined api host.
- Jevil.getThen()
- Jevil.postThen()
- Jevil.sendPushKeyWithDevilServer()
- etc
