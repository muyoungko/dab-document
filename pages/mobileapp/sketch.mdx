# Sketch to App

We do not support all of Sketch's features. For example, SVG nodes and complex gradients are not supported. However, we do provide workarounds for constructing application UIs.

Most SVG path images should be converted to bitmap image nodes. Our Sketch plugin can assist you with this conversion.

Here are some of the most useful constraints:

## Text

### Area

### Font

## Image

## Artboard for Screen
