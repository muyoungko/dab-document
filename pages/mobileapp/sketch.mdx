# Sketch to App

We do not support all of Sketch's features. For example, SVG nodes and complex gradients are not supported. However, we do provide workarounds for constructing application UIs.

Most SVG path images should be converted to bitmap image nodes. Our Sketch plugin can assist you with this conversion.

Here are some of the most useful constraints:

## Artboard for Screen

## Size Limit of 10MB

## Text

### Font

Sketch can set font. DAB don't support it.

### Area

### Text color

Sketch has 2 way to set text color 

* direct set text color (rigth pannel > Text > Color) : `secondary priority`
* fill color (rigth pannel > Fill > Color ) : `first priority`

## Image

### Path or vector image
`not surppot`

So it should be change to bitmap image. We provide easy way.

* Install Devil App Builder plugin : `Plugins > Devil App Builder > Node to Bitmap`

Then selected node becomes bitmap image. 
You have to keep original vector to another sketch
