## Host and Web Host

The app's API host is usually one, which is set commonly in the app and when using API in the app, only the path is attached

```javascript
Jevil.getThe('/api/product/list', function(res) {
    ...
})
```

The above code can be called variously according to the host setting as follows
 - Examples 
    - https://api.myservice.com/api/product/list
    - https://dev.myservice.com/api/product/list
    - http://localhost:8080/api/product/list


The way to set the host is to set API Host and Web Host in DAB Console > Project > Setting as follows.

- API Host is automatically set in the following http-related functions
    - Jevil.getThen()
    - Jevil.postThen()
    - Jevil.sendPushKeyWithDevilServer()
    - etc
- Web Host is automatically set in WebView block rule

## Host For Development

To develop the server and app, the app must look at my development server.
You can set development API Host and Web Host in DAB Console > Project > Setting > Development.
